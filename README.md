Learning and practicing React JS

## first-react

My first React project following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQxitgyZ_S4">this series of videos</a>. It covers a lot of functionalities of React such as communication between components, class and function components, components using the children property, etc. It really take a while to make but it was worth it. <br/>
