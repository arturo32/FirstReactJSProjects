Learning and practicing React JS

## first-react

My first React project following <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQxitgyZ_S4">this series of videos</a>. It covers a lot of functionalities of React such as  direct and indirect communication between components, class and functional components, components using the children property, etc. It really take a while to make but it was worth it. <br/>

## Contact Manager

Project inspired by the course of React + Redux of the Sololearn Android app. It uses concepts of state (hooks), separation of concerns, functional components and "lifting the state up" (indirect communication between components).
